### Data Management Plan


A data management plan (DMP) describes the strategies and measures for handling research data during and after a project. Its aim is to address and define the technical, organisational and legal aspects of research data management in a clearly defined document well in advance. Find out more about DMPs, how to write one and what tools are available:
