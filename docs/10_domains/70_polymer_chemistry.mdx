## Introduction

Polymer chemistry is focused on the synthesis and characterization of monomer units, macromolecules and resultant
materials for applications in e.g. optics, electronics and energy, packaging and containers, coatings and adhesives,
catalysis or medicine. Polymeric materials can be subdivided by their origin into synthetic, inorganic and
biopolymers, where the latter is a significant subject of recent research as they can be derived from renewable
resources and therefore are deemed to be part of the solution for a sustainable future. The toolbox for monomer synthesis and modification, their polymerization as well as post-functionalization are often translated form organic chemistry, yet for cutting-edge materials new experimental strategies have to be developed. Many characterization methods, especially for monomers or small polymers, can also be adapted from established organic chemistry. However, since macromolecules can feature highly complex structures, e.g. brushes, dendrimers, rings and star shapes, advanced methods such as (2D) SEC, LCCC, DOSY NMR, or electron microscopy need to be applied in order to obtain an exhaustive structure determination (for abbreviations see table below). For their subsequent application as high-tech material, their mechanical and physical properties play an important role as well, where cyclic voltammetry or rheological characterization are just a few examples for the vast array of techniques that are available. A standard approach for the development of new polymeric materials can be described as follows:

- Preparation of organic/inorganic monomer units.
- Small-scale experiments for screening/optimization of reaction conditions.
- Upscaling of reactions to obtain sufficient product for subsequent polymerization steps.
- (Co)polymerization of monomers in different ratios/chain lengths as well as optimization of reaction conditions.
- Post-polymerization functionalization.
- Synthesis of macroscopic materials through 3D printing, moulding etc.

## Data Types

Manually determined data: Experimental observations such as colour change or precipitants, appearance, yield and consistency of the product, solubility etc.
Digital data are obtained with analytical devices. An overview on file extensions, file sizes and converters for several analytical methods is given in the table below.
When necessary, pre-processing of digital data with software of analytical device before data are transferred.
Raw data files in proprietary file formats should be saved alongside interoperable open file formats by using converters or the software of the analytical device. If no specific open format is currently available, exporting as .txt or .csv is recommended. Please be aware that metadata included in the header of .txt or .csv files may not follow a defined (open) format and metadata should be additionally also added into the ELN.

## ELNs and Other Tools

For effective data management, software tools should be selected in a uniform manner within a project or research group with the aim to organize and streamline workflows. This involves establishing clear usage guidelines, including metadata templates drawn from minimum information standards for a given method, where available. These should be outlined in a data management plan (DMP) for each project. NFDI4Chem provides an RDMO template specifically tailored to the needs of chemists.

An electronic lab notebooks (ELN) helps in the day-to-day planning and structured documentation of experiments, while some also assist in data workflow management. For disciplines with diverse research, ELNs must be flexible and customizable. Certain universities may have a central option, while each research group may chose what best fits their needs and resources if they are able to host or procure their own solution. The ELN-Finder lists many options and the article on choosing an ELN provides further assistance:

## Publishing Data

For synthesis data and analytical data, specific repositories such as [Chemotion Repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) (synthesis data), [MassBankEU](https://massbank.eu/MassBank/) (mass spectra), or [nmrXiv](https://nmrxiv.org/) (for NMR data) are recommended. For other types of data the generic repository [RADAR4Chem](https://radar.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/de/radarabout/radar4chem) is recommended.
Publishing research data is important to allow other researchers to reuse it. To reach as many researchers as possible, choosing the right repository can be crucial (check the [Choose a Repository](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/docs/choose_repository/) article for more information).
